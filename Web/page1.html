        <h1>The World of Tecnology</h1>
        <div class="line1"></div>
        <p>
            The world of technology is ever-evolving, bringing forth innovations that continuously reshape our lives. From the advent of the internet to the rise of artificial intelligence, technology has become an integral part of our daily existence.
        </p>
        <h2>Types of tecnology</h2>
        <ul> 
            <li class="technologies">Artificial Intelligence (AI):</li>
            <p>
                AI involves creating systems that can perform tasks that typically require human intelligence, such as visual perception, speech recognition, decision-making, and language translation. 
            </p>
            <li class="technologies">Virtual Reality (VR):</li>
            <p>
                VR uses computer technology to create a simulated environment that can be explored and interacted with by a person. It immerses users in a completely virtual world.
            </p>
            <li class="technologies">Blockchain:</li>
            <p>
                This technology is a decentralized digital ledger that records transactions across many computers in such a way that the registered transactions cannot be altered retroactively. It’s the backbone of cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin.
            </p>
            <li class="technologies">Internet of Things (IoT):</li>
            <p>
                IoT refers to the network of physical objects—devices, vehicles, buildings, and other items—embedded with sensors, software, and other technologies to connect and exchange data with other devices and systems over the internet.
            </p>
            <li class="technologies">Nanotechnology:</li>
            <p>
                This involves manipulating matter on an atomic or molecular scale. It has applications in medicine, electronics, biomaterials, and energy production.
            </p>
        </ul>
